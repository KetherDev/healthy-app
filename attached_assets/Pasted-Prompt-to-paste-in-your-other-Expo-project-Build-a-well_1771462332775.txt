Prompt to paste in your other Expo project:

Build a wellness marketplace app called "Healthy" using React Native Expo with expo-router and Supabase as the backend. Connect to the existing Supabase project at URL https://eoyqjiehqjullmuopcbc.supabase.co. You'll need to set these environment variables:

EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://eoyqjiehqjullmuopcbc.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = (use the same anon key from secrets)
Install these dependencies: @supabase/supabase-js, expo-router, expo-secure-store, expo-status-bar, @expo/vector-icons, react-native-safe-area-context, react-native-screens, react-native-gesture-handler, date-fns

Design system:

Primary color: #4CAF7D (soft green), primaryLight: #E8F5EE, primaryDark: #3A8F64
Background: #FAFBFC, Surface: #FFFFFF, Text: #1A1D21
iOS-style rounded aesthetics with clean typography
Tab bar with icons only, no labels
Database tables already exist in Supabase with RLS enabled:

profiles (id, full_name, username, avatar_url, created_at) - auto-created via trigger on auth.users
establishments (id, name, type enum [gym/yoga/pilates/restaurant/meditation/crossfit], description, image_url, address, city, latitude, longitude, rating, review_count, amenities text[], price_range, featured boolean, created_at)
classes (id, establishment_id FK, name, description, instructor, instructor_image, duration int, price int in cents, max_spots, level, scheduled_at timestamp, created_at)
bookings (id, user_id FK to auth.users, class_id FK, status [confirmed/cancelled/completed], total_paid int, created_at)
favorites (id, user_id FK, establishment_id FK, unique constraint on user+establishment, created_at)
There are 8 establishments and 25+ classes already seeded.

App structure with expo-router file-based routing:

app/_layout.tsx - Root layout with AuthProvider wrapping Stack navigator. Screens: index, (tabs), auth, establishment/[id] (card presentation), booking/[classId] (modal presentation). On native, just render normally with SafeAreaView.

app/index.tsx - Entry point that checks auth session and redirects to /auth or /(tabs)/home.

app/auth.tsx - Login/register screen with email/password. Has logo (🌿 emoji), toggle between sign in and sign up, full name field for registration.

app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx - Bottom tab navigator with 4 tabs (icon-only, no labels): Discover (compass-outline), Search (search-outline), Bookings (calendar-outline), Profile (person-outline). Active tint: #4CAF7D.

app/(tabs)/home.tsx - Discovery screen with greeting "Hello, {firstName}", "Find your wellness" heading, horizontal scrollable category pills (Yoga 🧘, Gym 💪, Pilates 🤸, Food 🥗, Meditate 🧠, CrossFit 🏋️) that link to search with type filter, horizontally scrolling featured establishment cards with image overlay, and vertical list of nearby establishments with thumbnail, name, rating, address.

app/(tabs)/search.tsx - Search screen with text input, filter pills (All/Yoga/Gym/Pilates/Food/Meditate/CrossFit) using flexWrap, and result cards with image, name, description, rating, price.

app/(tabs)/bookings.tsx - Shows user's bookings split into Upcoming (confirmed) and Past (cancelled/completed). Each booking card shows class name, establishment name/image, date/time, status badge, and cancel button for confirmed ones.

app/(tabs)/profile.tsx - Profile screen with avatar initial, name, email, stats (upcoming/completed/total bookings), menu sections (Account, Preferences, Support), sign out button.

app/establishment/[id].tsx - Detail screen with hero image, back/favorite buttons, establishment info (type, name, rating, reviews, price, address, description, amenities as tags), and list of available classes with name, instructor, price, date/time, duration, level badge. Tapping a class goes to booking.

app/booking/[classId].tsx - Booking confirmation flow showing class name, instructor, description, location, date, time, duration, level, total price. Confirm button creates booking. Success screen with checkmark, booking details, and "View My Bookings" button.

Lib files:

lib/supabase.ts - Supabase client with expo-secure-store for native auth storage, autoRefreshToken, persistSession, detectSessionInUrl: false.
lib/auth.tsx - AuthProvider context with session, user, profile state. Functions: signIn, signUp (with username from email), signOut, refreshProfile. Listens to onAuthStateChange.
lib/types.ts - TypeScript types for Establishment, ClassSession, Booking, Profile, Favorite, EstablishmentType union.
lib/theme.ts - Design tokens: colors, spacing (xs:4 to xxxl:32), radius (sm:8 to full:999), typography (h1-label), shadows with elevation.
Hooks:

hooks/useEstablishments.ts - useEstablishments(typeFilter?), useFeaturedEstablishments(), useEstablishment(id)
hooks/useClasses.ts - useClasses(establishmentId) - filters to future dates
hooks/useBookings.ts - useBookings() with createBooking(classId, totalPaid) and cancelBooking(bookingId)
hooks/useFavorites.ts - useFavorites() with toggleFavorite(establishmentId) and isFavorite(id)
All data comes from Supabase. No hardcoded data, no local images. Establishment images are Unsplash URLs stored in image_url column. Use SafeAreaView properly on native for safe area insets.
